## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Workspace Save/Load**: Open photo windows are automatically saved on exit and restored on next launch — including position, size, zoom level, pan state, and maximized state. Full multi-monitor support via virtual screen coordinates.
- **Manual Layout Save/Load**: **File → Save Layout...** and **File → Load Layout...** menu items let you export/import workspace layouts to/from JSON files.
- **Chevron Click Fix**: Folder tree expand/collapse chevrons now respond reliably on the first click (changed from `MouseLeftButtonDown` to `MouseLeftButtonUp`).

### Changed
- **Left Panel Sizing Increased**: Default width 220→280, min 150→200, max 400→500. Icons enlarged (16→20, 18→22), font sizes increased (10→12, 11→13, 13→15), padding and spacing expanded throughout for a more comfortable reading experience.
- **Default Launch View**: Application now opens directly to the Gallery tab instead of requiring manual selection.
- **Photo Window Navigation**: Left/right navigation arrows are now visible as faint overlay buttons on the photo window edges.
- **Gallery Opens on Single Click**: Selecting a photo in the gallery now opens it immediately (changed from double-click).
- **Remove Source Fix**: Fixed context menu binding so right-click → Remove now properly removes local folder sources.
- **PhotoWindow Initialization**: Fixed issue where PhotoWindow wasn't loading the image from its ViewModel, breaking navigation.
- **PhotoWindow Title Bar**: Title bar dark mode now respects the app's theme setting (Light/Dark/System) instead of only following the system theme.

### Fixed
- Sort direction correctly applies to all sort options (File Name, Date Created, File Size).
- Context menu "Remove" source now correctly removes the selected source from the list.
- Photo thumbnails now open in PhotoWindow with a single click instead of requiring double-click.
- PhotoWindow correctly displays the loaded image (was showing gray screen due to missing binding).
- Favorite heart icons display fully without clipping on gallery thumbnails.
- Theme system properly applies dark mode to all UI elements (scrollbars, menus, sidebars, backgrounds, text).
- Settings cog icon renders without clipping in the custom title bar.
- MainWindow correctly loads the saved theme before XAML parsing begins.
- Gallery images now display with their true aspect ratios (portrait vs landscape) using the `JustifiedWrapPanel`.

### Gallery Improvements
- **Justified Gallery Layout**: Implemented `JustifiedWrapPanel` that arranges photos with variable widths based on actual aspect ratios, scaling each row to flush-fill the available width (like Google Photos).
- **Pixel Dimension Reading**: `LocalFolderProvider` now reads pixel dimensions from image files using `BitmapDecoder` for accurate aspect ratio calculation.
- **Fixed Row Height with Variable Widths**: Portrait photos appear narrower, landscape photos appear wider, creating a natural masonry-row layout.
- **Last Row Exception**: The final gallery row maintains target height and left-aligns without stretching when few images remain.
